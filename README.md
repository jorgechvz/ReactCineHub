# Overview

As a passionate software engineer, my primary goal in developing ReactCineHub, a web application utilizing The Movie Database (TMDb) API, is to enhance my skills and knowledge in software development. This project serves as a valuable learning experience, allowing me to explore React, Vite, and various UI libraries while building a functional and engaging movie-related web app.

To get started, one can easily launch a test server on their computer. After initiating the server, the first page of the app can be accessed by opening a web browser and navigating to the appropriate local or network address.

# Web Pages

- **Homepage**:
The home page serves as your initial starting point and displays a curated list of movies pulled from the TMDb API. Users can explore trending movies and access additional features, clicking on any movie will take you to the details page of the selected movie.

- **Movies page**:
This page provides a list view of movies. On this page, users can use filters as methods to sort the list of movies according to their desire. You can also find a pagination button to navigate to the different pages. Users can seamlessly navigate to this page from the home page.

- **Movie details page**:
For deeper exploration, the movie details page offers complete details about a selected movie. This includes such as the synopsis, the cast of the film, recommendations and whether the film has a collection.

- **Login page**:
The login page allows user authentication, paving the way for future features like custom watchlists and movie ratings.

Each page incorporates dynamic elements, dynamically fetched movie data, and interactive features for an engaging user experience.

# Development Environment

The development of ReactCineHub was made possible with the following tools and technologies:

- **React with Vite**: Leveraging the power of React in conjunction with Vite for a swift and efficient development environment. Vite's fast build times and React's component-based architecture contribute to a seamless development experience.

- **TMDb API (The Movie Database API)**: Integrating the TMDb API as the primary data source for movie information. This API provides a rich set of data, including details about movies, cast, reviews, and more, enriching the content and functionality of ReactCineHub.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilizing Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design. Tailwind's utility-first approach allows for rapid prototyping and easy maintenance of styles.

- **Shadcn/UI and NextUI**: Employing UI libraries such as Shadcn/UI and NextUI to integrate pre-designed components seamlessly into the application. This enhances the overall aesthetics and user experience of ReactCineHub.

- **React-icons**: Incorporating React-icons to easily integrate various icons into the user interface, enhancing the application's visual appeal and usability.

- **Node.js and npm**: Building on the Node.js runtime environment and npm package manager to manage project dependencies and streamline the development workflow.

These tools collectively contribute to a robust and efficient development environment, enabling the creation of a feature-rich and visually appealing web application.
